# UI Performance: Zed-level Smoothness v1 (TODO)

This file tracks milestones and concrete tasks for:

- `docs/workstreams/ui-perf-zed-smoothness-v1.md`

Conventions:

- “Contract” items should land with an ADR (or an update to an existing ADR).
- “Perf gate” items should land with a runnable `fretboard diag perf` command and a baseline/threshold update.
- “Fearless refactor” items should include: (1) perf evidence, (2) correctness evidence, (3) rollback plan.

## Milestones

### M0: Baseline + suite gates (make perf a contract)

- [ ] Decide Tier A / Tier B thresholds per script (initially “best-effort”, then tighten).
- [x] Decide what `--launch` represents (cold-start gate vs steady-state gate) and codify it.
  - `ui-gallery` + `--launch`: cold-start gate (mount + first interaction).
  - `ui-gallery-steady` + `--reuse-launch` + `--launch`: steady-state gate (post-mount interactions).
- [ ] Finalize the acceptance suite list (see `ui-perf-zed-smoothness-v1.md`) and keep it small.
  - Ensure it includes at least one editor-grade text surface (`ui-gallery-code-editor-torture-autoscroll-steady.json`).
- [x] Record initial baselines (one per machine profile) using `fretboard diag perf --perf-baseline-out`.
  - macOS (Apple M4): `docs/workstreams/perf-baselines/ui-gallery-steady.macos-m4.v1.json` (commit `50bfcc54`).
  - macOS (Apple M4): `docs/workstreams/perf-baselines/ui-gallery-steady.macos-m4.v2.json` (see perf log entry).
    - v1 was slightly flaky on `ui-gallery-window-resize-stress-steady` `max_top_solve_us` when checked with repeat=3.
      v2 bumps headroom to 30% to reduce false positives.
  - macOS (Apple M4): `docs/workstreams/perf-baselines/ui-gallery-steady.macos-m4.v4.json` (see perf log entry).
    - Includes the new `ui-gallery-hover-layout-torture-steady.json` script in the `ui-gallery-steady` suite.
    - v3 exists but is superseded by v4 (hover script cleanup to reduce cross-script state contamination).
  - macOS (Apple M4): `docs/workstreams/perf-baselines/ui-gallery-steady.macos-m4.v5.json` (see perf log entry).
    - Switches perf protocol to `FRET_DIAG_SCRIPT_AUTO_DUMP=0` to avoid per-step bundle dumps dominating I/O.
    - Supersedes v4 for perf gating; keep v4 only if you explicitly want “auto dump on” behavior for debugging.
- [x] Add a “how to run locally” snippet to the workstream doc (keep it copy/paste friendly).
- [ ] Create a “known-noise sources” section (thermal, background apps, debug vs release, shader compile).
- [x] Pick one canonical view-cache setting for the suite and enforce it via `--env` in scripts.
  - Candidate: `FRET_UI_GALLERY_VIEW_CACHE=1` + `FRET_UI_GALLERY_VIEW_CACHE_SHELL=1`.
- [x] Create a commit-addressable perf log:
  - `docs/workstreams/ui-perf-zed-smoothness-v1-log.md`
- [x] Add a helper to append suite results to the log:
  - `tools/perf/perf_log.py`
- [x] Record an initial suite run in the log (repeat=7).
- [x] Add a steady-state suite and reuse-launched-process support:
  - `fretboard diag perf ui-gallery-steady --reuse-launch --launch -- cargo run -p fret-ui-gallery --release`
- [x] Record a `ui-gallery-steady` baseline in the perf log (repeat=7, `--reuse-launch`).
  - See `docs/workstreams/ui-perf-zed-smoothness-v1-log.md` entry for commit `686bebe1`.
- [x] Stabilize view-cache key to avoid resize-driven `cache_key_mismatch`.
  - Implemented by `perf(fret-ui): stabilize view-cache key` (commit `b6f1b580`).
- [x] Add a resize-smoothness knob for scroll extents: defer unbounded probes while the viewport is resizing.
  - Implemented by `perf(fret-ui): defer unbounded scroll probe on resize` (commit `05d2d56c`).
  - Env: `FRET_UI_SCROLL_DEFER_UNBOUNDED_PROBE_ON_INVALIDATION=1`
  - Debounce: `FRET_UI_SCROLL_DEFER_UNBOUNDED_PROBE_STABLE_FRAMES` (default: 2)
- [ ] Decide whether scroll unbounded-probe deferral should become the default (remove env gating) and
  update the canonical perf suite env set accordingly.
- [x] Export view-cache reuse “miss reasons” as perf-visible counters (so regressions are explainable).
  - Implemented by `feat(diag): export view-cache reuse miss counters` (commit `43f9c73e`).

### M1: Frame data structures (hashing → dense)

Primary targets (highest leverage):

- [x] Refactor `WindowFrame` stores to avoid per-frame `HashMap` churn:
  - `crates/fret-ui/src/declarative/frame.rs` (`WindowFrame.instances`, `WindowFrame.children`)
  - Landed as `slotmap::SecondaryMap<NodeId, ...>` (commit `448c34ad`).
- [x] Avoid rewriting `WindowFrame.children` when the child list is unchanged (reduce per-frame `Arc<[NodeId]>` allocations).
  - Implemented by `perf(fret-ui): skip unchanged window frame children` (commit `cce827ad`).
- [x] Avoid cloning child lists when calling `UiTree::set_children*` from declarative mount (reduce per-frame heap churn).
  - Implemented by `perf(fret-ui): avoid cloning child lists in mount` (commit `089bac9b`).
- [ ] Replace `Arc<[NodeId]>` for `WindowFrame.children` with a reuse-friendly representation.
  - Candidate: store `Vec<NodeId>` in a slab/arena and reference by index + generation.
- [x] Replace invalidation “visited”/scratch `HashMap<NodeId, u8>` with generation-stamped tables:
  - `crates/fret-ui/src/tree/mod.rs` invalidation propagation caches.
  - Implemented by `perf(fret-ui): generation-stamp invalidation propagation` (commit `a540829e`).
  - Evidence: `docs/workstreams/ui-perf-zed-smoothness-v1-log.md` entries for commit `a540829e`.
- [ ] Ensure deterministic ordering is preserved where diagnostics rely on it (bundle stability).

Perf acceptance:

- [ ] `ui-gallery-overlay-torture.json`: p95 total improves; invalidation nodes/calls do not regress.
- [ ] `ui-gallery-virtual-list-torture.json`: tail latency improves or stays flat.
- [x] Investigate post-`a540829e` suite deltas (noise vs real regression) and decide next step:
  - If real: profile invalidation propagation micro-costs and consider alternative dense map strategy (or env gating).
  - If noise: standardize suite runs on explicit `--dir` and pin a baseline via `--perf-baseline-out`.
  - Result: A/B rerun at `448c34ad` is within noise vs the current baseline (see perf log).

### M2: Allocation model (per-frame scratch arena)

- [ ] Introduce a `FrameArena` (or equivalent) for UI runtime scratch allocations.
  - Reference: `repo-ref/zed/crates/gpui/src/arena.rs`.
- [x] Reuse a small set of per-frame scratch buffers to reduce allocator churn.
  - `perf(fret-ui): reuse frame scratch buffers` (commit `a39e79c4`).
- [x] Reuse view-cache GC “keep-alive” scratch collections (HashSet/Vec) to reduce per-frame allocations.
  - `perf(fret-ui): reuse view-cache keepalive scratch` (commit `cb3ff2d9`).
  - A/B gate: `perf(fret-ui): gate view-cache keepalive scratch` (commit `968305b9`)
    - `FRET_UI_VIEW_CACHE_KEEPALIVE_SCRATCH_DISABLE=1` disables scratch reuse.
  - Status: A/B is within noise on:
    - code editor autoscroll (`tools/diag-scripts/ui-gallery-code-editor-torture-autoscroll-steady.json`)
    - view-cache toggle perf steady (`tools/diag-scripts/ui-gallery-view-cache-toggle-perf-steady.json`)
    - overlay torture steady (`tools/diag-scripts/ui-gallery-overlay-torture-steady.json`)
    (see perf log entries for `968305b9`).
- [ ] Convert at least 2 hot scratch paths to arena-backed allocation:
  - Candidate A: semantics snapshot traversal scratch (stack + visited).
  - Candidate B: GC reachability scratch sets / temporary vectors in mount/GC.
- [ ] Add an optional allocation counter hook for local profiling (feature-gated).
  - Keep it portable; do not require a global allocator swap for normal builds.

Correctness acceptance:

- [ ] Existing `cargo nextest run -p fret-ui` remains green.
- [ ] `fretboard diag repro ui-gallery` smoke suite passes.

### M3: Hit testing (bounds tree / spatial index)

- [x] Implement a bounds tree built during prepaint per hit-testable layer root.
  - Implemented by `perf(fret-ui): add bounds tree hit-test index` (commit `75a9fde3`).
  - Note: current implementation supports axis-aligned transforms only (no rotation/shear).
- [x] Route pointer move/down hit-testing through the bounds tree for large trees.
  - Implemented by `75a9fde3` (hooked via `UiTree::hit_test_layers_cached`).
- [x] Define “fallback” conditions clearly (transforms, clips, non-axis-aligned bounds).
  - Supports `clips_hit_test=false` (overflow-visible hit testing) by propagating the ancestor clip (instead of
    disabling the index for the entire layer).
  - Disabled for a layer if any transform is non-axis-aligned (`b!=0` or `c!=0`).
  - Env toggles:
    - `FRET_UI_HIT_TEST_BOUNDS_TREE_DISABLE=1` disables the index.
    - `FRET_UI_HIT_TEST_BOUNDS_TREE_MIN_RECORDS` (default: 256) gates building for small trees.
- [ ] Add a stress script gate that correlates pointer-move frequency with stable frame time.
  - Candidate: extend `tools/diag-scripts/ui-gallery-hover-layout-torture.json`.
  - Follow-up: current `diag perf` totals do not include dispatch/hit-test time directly; see next item.
- [x] Add a dispatch/hit-test time metric to diagnostics so we can gate pointer-move cost explicitly.
  - Implemented by `perf(diag): expose dispatch and hit-test timing` (commit `4b0be50e`).
  - Adds new `fretboard diag perf --sort dispatch|hit_test` modes and exports:
    - `top_dispatch_time_us`, `top_hit_test_time_us`
    - `top_dispatch_events`, `top_hit_test_queries`
- [x] Add a dedicated hit-test drag stress script (high pointer event density).
  - Script: `tools/diag-scripts/ui-gallery-hit-test-drag-sweep-steady.json`
  - Use with: `fretboard diag perf ... --sort hit_test`
- [x] Add a multi-frame pointer-move sweep step for realistic hover/hit-test measurements.
  - Implemented by `perf(diag): add move_pointer_sweep script step` (commit `4941baa1`).
  - Scripts:
    - `tools/diag-scripts/ui-gallery-hit-test-move-sweep-steady.json`
    - `tools/diag-scripts/ui-gallery-hit-test-data-table-move-sweep-steady.json`
- [x] Find (or construct) a workload where `top_hit_test_time_us` is a meaningful slice of the frame budget.
  - Page: `apps/fret-ui-gallery/src/ui.rs` (`hit_test_torture`)
  - Script: `tools/diag-scripts/ui-gallery-hit-test-torture-stripes-move-sweep-steady.json`
  - Harness-only mode (to remove gallery chrome noise): `FRET_UI_GALLERY_HARNESS_ONLY=hit_test_torture`
  - Evidence + metrics: see `docs/workstreams/ui-perf-zed-smoothness-v1-log.md` entries after commit `811101c3`.
- [x] Add a smaller torture script variant to make scaling runs practical (avoid 10GB+ bundles).
  - Script: `tools/diag-scripts/ui-gallery-hit-test-torture-stripes-move-sweep-mini.json`
  - Implemented by `feat(diag-scripts): add mini hit-test torture sweep` (commit `1b3d2db3`).
  - Use: `FRET_DIAG_SCRIPT_AUTO_DUMP=0` + `FRET_DIAG_SEMANTICS=0` + `FRET_DIAG_MAX_SNAPSHOTS=120`.
- [ ] Investigate why the torture workload is still layout/prepaint-dominant on the sampled frames.
  - Goal: create (or tune) a variant where pointer moves are paint-only and hit-test cost is isolated.
  - Hypotheses: hover policy triggers layout; retained tree has a per-frame relayout; noise elements invalidate layout.
  - Deliverable: a new/updated script + a log entry demonstrating low `layout_time_us` while `hit_test_time_us` remains measurable.

Perf acceptance:

- [ ] Pointer-move heavy cases should stay paint-only (no layout) unless explicitly required.
- [ ] Hit-test CPU time should be bounded as node count scales.

### M4: Windowed surfaces (prepaint-driven visible windows)

- [ ] Pick the first “editor-class” migration target:
  - Option A: VirtualList visible window derivation in prepaint (ADR 0190 alignment).
  - Option B: Code view visible-line window derivation in prepaint (code editor feel).
- [ ] Ensure cache-root reuse remains stable under steady scroll/pan.
- [ ] Add a “window boundary crossing” script that fails if it triggers full rerender too often.

Perf acceptance:

- [ ] `ui-gallery-virtual-list-torture.json`: steady scroll should avoid cache-root rerender in most frames.
- [ ] `ui-gallery-code-view-scroll-refresh-baseline.json`: no hitch spikes after warmup.

### M5: Text pipeline stabilization (editor-ready)

- [ ] Document stable cache keys for measure/shaping (wrap width, font stack, style).
- [ ] Reduce redundant text measurements under intrinsic probes (layout engine + `TextWrap::None` paths).
- [x] Add a fast path for “min-content probes” (e.g. `wrap=Word` + `max_width=0`) to avoid O(n²) text wrapping.
  - Implemented by `perf(fret-render): fast-path wrapped text measure` (see perf log entry for commit `9440648a`).
- [x] Reduce repeated shaping work when taffy calls `measure()` under multiple intrinsic modes (min/max/definite).
  - Implemented by caching single-line shaping + cluster-based wrap stats (see `ui-perf-zed-smoothness-v1-log.md`).
- [x] Cut code editor syntax paint cost in the “autoscroll torture” probe (p95 paint drops from ~23ms → ~5ms).
  - Implemented by `perf(fret-code-editor): cache syntax rich rows` (commit `81159325`).
  - Evidence: `docs/workstreams/ui-perf-zed-smoothness-v1-log.md` entries for commit `bd709f88` (baseline) and `81159325`.
- [ ] Add diagnostics hooks to identify text cache misses that correlate with perf hitches.
- [ ] Ensure atlas eviction and re-upload events are observable in perf snapshots.

Perf acceptance:

- [ ] Editor-class pages remain within Tier A budgets; Tier B progress is tracked.

### M6: Perf gates in CI (optional, but recommended)

- [ ] Define a reduced suite for CI (fast, stable, platform-agnostic as much as possible).
- [ ] Decide baseline storage approach (per platform, per hardware class).
- [ ] Add a “perf regression triage” template: which bundle artifacts to attach, how to compare.

## Cross-cutting hygiene

- [ ] When a refactor changes a hard-to-change behavior, capture it as an ADR and update
  `docs/adr/IMPLEMENTATION_ALIGNMENT.md` if relevant.
- [ ] Prefer tooling-driven evidence: `bundle.json`, `check.*.json`, and reproducible scripts.
- [ ] Keep `fret-ui` policy-light (mechanisms only; policy stays in ecosystem; see ADR 0066).
- [ ] Track GPUI performance gaps explicitly and close them with measurable gates:
  - `docs/workstreams/ui-perf-gpui-gap-v1.md`
- [ ] Keep diagnostics artifacts bounded (especially `target/fret-diag*` and `target/fret-diag-perf`).
  - Default script auto-dump can generate hundreds of GB if left on across long perf sessions.
  - Prefer `FRET_DIAG_SCRIPT_AUTO_DUMP=0` for perf probes and clean old run directories periodically.
