# Paint evaluation spaces v1

This workstream implements ADR 0306:

- `docs/adr/0306-paint-evaluation-spaces-v1.md`

## Why this exists

Fret already supports gradient paints in the scene contract (`Paint::LinearGradient`, etc.), but the
evaluation coordinate is effectively fixed to the op’s local scene space (ADR 0233 D4).

Editor-grade ecosystems need two additional, reusable mechanisms:

1. **Viewport-stable paint evaluation** (screen-space effects that do not “swim” when content pans).
2. **Stroke-space paint evaluation** (gradients/materials that follow curve length, not XY
   projection).

The key design constraint remains: this is **mechanism**, not policy. Node-graph “wire kinds” and
style rules remain in ecosystem crates; the renderer only provides the evaluation domains.

## Contract summary (from ADR 0306)

Introduce `PaintEvalSpaceV1`:

- `LocalPx` (existing)
- `ViewportPx` (screen space)
- `StrokeS01` (normalized arclength along stroke)

Bind the eval space per paint usage site via a small value type (e.g. `PaintBindingV1`), and ensure
validation + fingerprinting include the evaluation space.

## Implementation sketch (wgpu backend)

### Quad / StrokeRRect

- `LocalPx`: unchanged (use existing `local_pos`).
- `ViewportPx`: pass `pixel_pos` to paint eval.
- `StrokeS01`: for rounded-rect strokes, reuse the existing perimeter `s` computation used by dash
  masks to produce `s01`, then evaluate paint at `paint_pos = vec2(s01, 0)`.

### Path (fill vs stroke)

`StrokeS01` requires an `s01` domain per fragment:

- For stroke-prepared paths (`PathStyle::StrokeV2+`), use lyon’s stroke tessellation data (vertex
  advancement) to generate a per-vertex `s` attribute.
- Normalize to `s01` using a stable path-length denominator.

Dash × StrokeS01:

- Target semantics (ADR 0306 D5): `s01` is continuous across the underlying centerline, independent
  of dash patterns. The dash mask must be derived from the same `s` domain.

This implies we may need to evolve the current CPU “split path into dash segments then tessellate”
implementation if it breaks continuity.

## Gates (fearless refactor safety)

Minimum gates before ecosystem adoption:

- A conformance test that proves gradient strokes still work after renderer refactors:
  - `crates/fret-render-wgpu/tests/stroke_paint_conformance.rs`
- A note: this conformance test pins the *existing* LocalPx behavior. New eval spaces will require
  additional gates once the contract is implemented.
- A cache-key / fingerprint gate for eval-space changes (once the contract is implemented).
- A diag script (optional) that toggles eval spaces on a single scene and records bundles for
  regressions.

## Out of scope (v1)

- Arbitrary shader graphs.
- Ecosystem policy surfaces (wire style recipes, node graph skins).
- Cross-backend parity beyond deterministic degradation rules.
