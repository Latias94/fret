# UI Gallery Layout Correctness — Tracker

Status: Draft (workstream note; ADRs remain the source of truth)

This document tracks **layout correctness** (wrong bounds, wrong sizing, wrong clipping) issues found in
`apps/fret-ui-gallery`, with a bias toward bugs that are **visually severe** and **deterministically reproducible**.

For performance investigations, see `docs/workstreams/ui-gallery-perf-scroll-measure.md`.

## 0) Goal

- Turn “looks wrong” reports into **repeatable repro bundles** + **minimal test cases**.
- Fix root causes in the correct layer (policy vs mechanism).
- Prevent regressions with scripted repros and/or unit tests.

## 1) Triage Checklist (Layout vs Visual)

Before digging into code, classify the problem:

1. **Layout issue**: bounds are wrong (hit-testing, clipping, scroll extents, overlays anchored to the wrong rect).
2. **Visual issue**: bounds are correct, but rendering is wrong (transform stack, clip/scissor, effect bounds).

Reference workflow: `docs/debugging-playbook.md`.

## 2) Collection Workflow (Preferred)

### 2.1 Capture a deterministic diagnostics bundle (recommended)

- Use `fretboard diag run` with an existing script, or add a new `tools/diag-scripts/ui-gallery-*.json`.
- Enable readback screenshots when the bug is visual:
  - `FRET_DIAG=1`
  - `FRET_DIAG_SCREENSHOTS=1`

### 2.2 Dump the solved layout tree (when bounds are wrong)

```powershell
$env:FRET_TAFFY_DUMP=1
$env:FRET_TAFFY_DUMP_ONCE=1
$env:FRET_TAFFY_DUMP_DIR=".fret\\taffy-dumps"

# Prefer filtering by a stable semantics label when possible:
$env:FRET_TAFFY_DUMP_ROOT_LABEL="Debug:ui-gallery:..."
```

Notes:

- Prefer a stable `SemanticsProps.label` or `test_id`-adjacent label wrapper around the region.
- Avoid dumping in perf-critical runs (dumps will stutter).

### 2.3 Compare two bundles (regressions / “only happens with toggle X”)

Use `fretboard diag compare`:

- If you want correctness only (ignoring bounds), add: `--compare-ignore-bounds`.
- If the bug is bounds-related, keep bounds enabled and set a strict epsilon: `--compare-eps-px <px>`.

## 3) Active Issues

| ID | Severity | Page | Symptom | Repro Script | Status | Owner | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | P0 | (TBD) | (TBD) | (TBD) | Open | (TBD) | Add screenshot + expected vs actual |

## 4) Next Actions

- Pick the top P0 issue and add a dedicated `tools/diag-scripts/ui-gallery-...json` repro.
- Add `SemanticsProps.test_id` / labels to make the hot region and broken bounds discoverable in bundles and dumps.
- Convert the repro into a `crates/fret-ui/src/declarative/tests/*` test when possible.
