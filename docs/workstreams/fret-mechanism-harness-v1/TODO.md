# TODO

- [x] Create the dedicated workstream and coverage map.
- [x] Extend `fret-mechanism-harness` with scalar mechanism metrics for non-geometry facts.
- [x] Add fixture-driven layout dirty invalidation cases for suppressed boundaries and repair paths.
- [x] Connect the checkbox "Enable notifications" underflow path as the first UI Gallery runtime
  diagnostics gate.
- [x] Run the first gate set and record actual command results in `FINDINGS_2026-05-11.md`.
- [x] If a new confirmed defect appears, fix it in the owning layer and add regression coverage.
  - Result: no new confirmed defect appeared in this slice; the known suppressed-boundary defect was
    already fixed and is now locked by fixture coverage plus diagnostics.
- [x] Pick the next slice from the largest uncovered mechanism gap.
- [x] Extend layout dirty invalidation fixtures into view-cache/root-boundary invalidation:
  retained contained relayout, scroll/direct-child dirty frontier coverage, detached dirty-cache-root
  pruning, and view-cache layout-dirty expansion attribution.
- [x] Run focused gates for the view-cache/root-boundary slice and record the results.
