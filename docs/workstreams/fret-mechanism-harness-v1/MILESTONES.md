# Milestones

## M0: Lane Shape

Status: complete

- Dedicated workstream exists.
- Coverage map names current coverage and gaps.
- First-open gates are listed in `WORKSTREAM.json`.

## M1: Layout and Invalidation Slice

Status: complete

- Layout primitive fixture remains the baseline geometry suite.
- Layout dirty invalidation gains fixture-driven scalar metric coverage.
- Suppressed-boundary child dirty deltas and subtree removal are case-id-addressable.

## M2: Runtime Gate Connection

Status: complete

- UI Gallery checkbox underflow script is the first real runtime proof.
- The script remains part of `diag-hardening-smoke`.
- Synthetic dirty invalidation cases explain the same class of mechanism risk.

## M3: Findings Loop

Status: complete for the first slice

- Run the gate set.
- Classify defects by layer.
- Fix confirmed defects.
- Leave evidence, regression coverage, and the next-slice recommendation.

## M4: View-Cache and Root-Boundary Invalidation Slice

Status: complete

- The layout dirty invalidation fixture now covers retained contained relayout, dirty frontier
  coverage at a wrapper/direct-child boundary, detached dirty-cache-root pruning, and view-cache
  layout-dirty expansion attribution.
- The harness runner can capture intermediate metrics so frontier state can be asserted before
  layout consumes it.
- Focused gates for `view_cache`, scroll-contained frontier behavior, and layout request build-root
  attribution passed.

## M5: Scroll-Handle Window-Update Slice

Status: complete

- A dedicated scroll-handle invalidation fixture suite now covers scroll registry change
  classification outcomes that affect cache-root reuse.
- The fixture matrix covers generic windowed scroll paint, virtual-list window escape,
  revision-only baseline handling after internal offset updates, and detached stale binding
  filtering.
- Focused gates for `view_cache_scroll`, retained virtual-list host reconcile, and scroll registry
  classification passed.

## M6: Environment View-Cache Invalidation Slice

Status: complete

- A dedicated environment view-cache fixture suite now drives the real `WindowMetricsService`
  entry point instead of direct `ElementRuntime` mutation.
- The first run exposed a confirmed mechanism defect: several platform environment keys were not
  committed into `ElementRuntime` before declarative rendering.
- `render_root` now synchronizes the missing environment keys, and the fixture plus focused
  environment gates pass.
