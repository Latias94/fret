# Scroll Extents (DOM/GPUI Parity)

This workstream proposes a more scalable scroll extent strategy for `fret-ui` that avoids deep
`measure()` probes for large scrollable surfaces (notably UI Gallery page content, markdown/code
views, and other editor-grade panels).

For the current UI Gallery perf investigation context, see:

- `docs/workstreams/ui-gallery-perf-scroll-measure.md`

## Problem Statement

Today, `ScrollProps::probe_unbounded = true` drives a MaxContent-style probe on the scroll axis.
This often forces a deep subtree `measure()` walk to determine the scrollable content extent.

In debug/dev builds, this can cause noticeable stalls on page switches (e.g. UI Gallery nav click)
because the frame is blocked inside recursive measurement rather than only doing a single final
layout pass.

Short-term mitigation (experimental; evidence tracked in `docs/workstreams/ui-gallery-perf-scroll-measure.md`):

- defer the unbounded probe by one frame when the scroll content subtree is layout-invalidated, using last-frame
  `measured_size` as an estimate for the first post-click frame.

## Current Implementation (as of 2026-03-02)

This section is descriptive (not the target contract).

### Mechanism surfaces

- `ScrollProps::probe_unbounded` (default: `true`) controls whether the scroll content is measured
  using MaxContent available space on the scroll axis.
- `ScrollIntrinsicMeasureMode::Viewport` is an intrinsic-sizing-only escape hatch that avoids deep
  scroll subtree measurement during Min/MaxContent measurement passes, without changing final layout
  semantics.
- `ScrollHandle` stores `viewport_size`, `content_size`, and `offset`, and clamps `offset` based on
  `max_offset = max(content - viewport, 0)` (see `crates/fret-ui/src/scroll/mod.rs`).

Evidence anchors:

- Props/state: `crates/fret-ui/src/element.rs`
- Intrinsic measurement: `crates/fret-ui/src/declarative/host_widget/measure.rs`
- Layout + extent probing/caches: `crates/fret-ui/src/declarative/host_widget/layout/scrolling.rs`

### Layout algorithm (high-level)

In `layout_scroll_impl(...)` today:

1. Build child constraints:
   - along the scroll axis, use `AvailableSpace::MaxContent` when `probe_unbounded = true`;
   - otherwise use `AvailableSpace::Definite(viewport_axis_size)`.
2. Measure each child (`measure_in`) to compute a `max_child` size.
3. Compute `desired` (viewport) by clamping `max_child` to `ScrollProps.layout` and the available
   size.
4. Compute `content_size` from `max_child` (with scroll-axis rounding) and ensure it is at least
   the viewport size (DOM-like invariant).
5. During final layout passes, update the scroll handle:
   - `set_viewport_size_internal(desired)`
   - `set_content_size_internal(content_size)`
   - `set_offset_internal(prev_offset)` (re-clamps after size updates)
6. Layout children into `content_bounds = Rect(origin = cx.bounds.origin, size = content_size)`.

To mitigate stalls and correctness issues around caching/deferral, the implementation also:

- defers deep unbounded probes on resize or transient invalidation (runtime knobs in
  `crates/fret-ui/src/runtime_config.rs`);
- caches probe results within a frame and across frames;
- performs a post-layout “observed overflow” pass that can:
  - expand `content_size` when descendants overflow but the deep probe was deferred/cached, and
  - clamp `content_size` down after shrink in deferral flows.

## Target Contract (SE-100)

This is the normative contract for a DOM/GPUI-like scroll extent strategy. The goal is to define
what “scroll extents” mean in `fret-ui` independently of the current probing implementation.

### Definitions

- **Viewport rect**: the final scroll node bounds after applying `ScrollProps.layout` constraints.
- **Content space**: the coordinate space of child layout bounds prior to applying the runtime
  scroll render transform. Scroll offsets translate children in paint/hit-test, not in layout.
- **Content extent**: a size `(content_width, content_height)` such that:
  - it is derived from post-layout geometry (not from a pre-layout unbounded probe), and
  - it bounds the scrollable overflow region in content space.

### Coordinate spaces and transforms

1. Extents are computed from **layout bounds** (`UiTree::node_bounds`) in content space.
2. Extents must **not** depend on:
   - the current scroll offset, or
   - render-time transforms (e.g. visual transforms / effects), or
   - pixel-snapped paint geometry.

Rationale: scroll extents must be stable across frames and independent of transient paint-only
effects, matching DOM/GPUI expectations.

### Extent derivation (post-layout geometry)

After the final layout pass for the scroll subtree:

1. Compute `observed_extent` from post-layout bounds:
   - Consider the scroll content subtree rooted at the scroll node’s child roots.
   - Use the union of descendant **layout bounds** projected into content space to compute:
     - `observed_right = max(bounds.right - content_origin.x, 0)`
     - `observed_bottom = max(bounds.bottom - content_origin.y, 0)`
   - Then `observed_extent = Size(observed_right, observed_bottom)`.
2. Apply axis-specific rounding:
   - On the scroll axis, round **up** to the next whole pixel (`ceil`) to avoid under-reporting due
     to fractional layout rounding (DOM-like). Implementations should tolerate small floating point
     noise (e.g. subtract a tiny epsilon before `ceil`).
   - Cross axis uses the viewport size unless a dedicated cross-axis overflow mode is enabled.
3. Enforce invariants:
   - `content_size.width >= viewport_size.width`
   - `content_size.height >= viewport_size.height`
4. Update the scroll handle (final pass only):
   - set `viewport_size` and `content_size` using internal setters (do not bump revisions),
   - clamp the offset after updates.

### Chrome / padding / border policy

`fret-ui` scroll extents are defined in terms of **layout geometry** only. There is no implicit
padding/border contribution to `content_size` at the mechanism level.

If a component library wants visual padding to affect scroll extents (e.g. “scroll padding”), it
must do so explicitly by inserting a layout wrapper in the scroll content subtree.

### Negative origins policy

When projecting bounds into content space, negative origins must not make extents negative. Use
`max(..., 0)` for projected coordinates so the scrollable content box remains well-defined even if
some children are positioned above/left of the content origin.

### Interaction with overlays / anchoring

Scroll extent updates must not introduce additional layout passes.

The scroll content extent and `ScrollHandle` clamping must be derived from the same final layout
geometry that powers `bounds_for_element(...)` / overlay anchoring queries. This keeps overlay
placement stable and avoids “anchor uses old bounds while scroll uses new extents” mismatches.

#### SE-213 harness contract (scroll + overlay parity)

We treat “overlay anchoring parity” as a *cross-cutting* correctness requirement:

- When a scripted interaction causes scroll content height to change (e.g. switching a doc “Code”
  tab that expands a code block), the scroll extents update must be reflected in the same
  post-layout geometry source that overlay anchoring uses.
- When an anchored overlay is opened after such a change, it must solve against the updated anchor
  rect and remain clamped within the window.

Because this spans multiple systems (layout, scroll handle clamping, overlay solver), the minimal
verification path is currently a diagnostics harness (scripts + evidence queries), not unit tests.

Planned gate (SE-213):

- Script: a UI Gallery regression script that:
  1) opens an anchored overlay and captures `overlay_placement_trace`,
  2) expands a doc code tab (content growth) and proves scroll can still reach a lower section,
  3) re-opens the overlay and asserts `bounds_within_window` for the overlay panel.
- Tooling: `fretboard diag query overlay-placement-trace ...` prints/JSON-dumps the captured
  `script.result.json` evidence for offline triage (anchor rect, chosen side, final rect, shift
  delta, step/frame correlation).

Evidence anchors:

- Script: `tools/diag-scripts/ui-gallery/overlay/ui-gallery-tooltip-overlay-placement-after-code-tab-scroll-range.json`
- Query example:
  - `fretboard diag query overlay-placement-trace target/fret-diag/<run_id> --kind anchored_panel --anchor-test-id ui-gallery-tooltip-demo-trigger --json`

#### SE-213c evidence (baseline vs post-layout gate)

Status: recorded (2026-03-02, macOS aarch64, debug build).

Runs:

- Baseline (default extents): PASS (`run_id=1772436210204`)
  - Out dir: `target/fret-diag-se213c2-baseline`
- Gate on (`FRET_UI_SCROLL_EXTENTS_POST_LAYOUT=1`): PASS (`run_id=1772436308115`)
  - Out dir: `target/fret-diag-se213c2-post-layout`

Notes:

- `overlay_placement_trace` for tooltips may have `content_test_id=null` (the tooltip root element
  is used as the content identity). Filter by `--anchor-test-id` when querying.
- When using `--session-auto`, `fretboard diag query overlay-placement-trace <base_out_dir>`
  resolves to the nearest evidence-bearing `script.result.json` (session root), not bundle dump
  subdirectories.

### Inclusion / exclusion rules

These rules define which nodes can influence the scrollable extent:

- **Exclude** absolute-positioned nodes by default.
  - Motivation: absolute nodes often represent overlays, chrome, or hit-test scaffolding that
    should not silently change scroll ranges.
  - Status: standardized in SE-113 (post-layout observation now filters absolute nodes, matching
    the intrinsic measurement path).
  - Evidence: `crates/fret-ui/src/declarative/host_widget/layout/scrolling.rs`
- **Include** normal-flow descendants (including wrapper nodes) even if their own bounds are forced
  to match the viewport/content rect, as long as their descendants’ layout bounds overflow.

### Shrink behavior

When content shrinks, `content_size` is allowed to decrease in the same frame, and the scroll
offset must be clamped accordingly (matching `ScrollHandle` clamping semantics).

To avoid jarring oscillation on frames where probes/observation are partial, implementations may
apply small hysteresis (e.g. sub-pixel tolerances), but must not permanently “pin” content extents
to stale values.

## SE-110: Overflow Blockers Audit (as of 2026-03-02)

This section inventories current mechanism behaviors that can prevent post-layout extent derivation
from observing true overflow unless an explicit MaxContent/unbounded probe is performed.

The intent is to make SE-200 (prototype) realistic by identifying the smallest set of mechanism
changes required to support DOM/GPUI-like overflow.

### Root architectural constraint: layout uses definite `Rect` bounds

In `fret-ui` today, the layout phase passes **definite bounds** (`Rect`) from parent to child
(`layout_in(...)`). Many widgets treat `cx.available` (the bounds size) as a **hard maximum**
through `clamp_to_constraints(...)`.

Implication:

- Without an explicit “unbounded/MaxContent budget” concept in *layout*, the only way to allow a
  subtree to grow beyond its viewport-sized ancestor is to feed it a larger bounds rect (or to run
  a separate intrinsic measurement probe that computes such bounds).

This is the core reason the current scroll implementation uses `probe_unbounded` + deep
`measure_in(...)` to compute a `content_bounds` rect before laying out children.

### Blocker: `clamp_to_constraints(...)` treats `available` as a hard maximum (even for `Auto`)

`clamp_to_constraints(...)` always clamps the final `size.{width,height}` to `available`, even when
the corresponding style length is `Auto`.

This makes “auto-sized children can exceed the viewport and overflow” difficult to express in pure
post-layout terms: if parents consistently pass viewport-sized `Rect`s and children clamp to that
available size, then overflow never materializes in `node_bounds` for extents observation to union.

Evidence anchors:

- `crates/fret-ui/src/declarative/layout_helpers.rs` (`clamp_to_constraints`, final clamp to
  `available`)
- Callsite notes that depend on this behavior:
  - `crates/fret-ui/src/declarative/host_widget/layout/scrolling.rs`
  - `crates/fret-ui/src/declarative/host_widget/layout/positioned_container.rs`

### Budget-clamping wrappers (block overflow discovery)

Several common wrappers explicitly measure/probe children **within the parent’s constrained size**
to avoid “infinite viewport” outcomes during intrinsic sizing and to keep virtualized content from
seeing unbounded budgets.

These are correct for their original goals, but they also mean a post-layout extent strategy will
under-observe overflow unless the scroll mechanism provides a layout-time “scroll axis is
unbounded” budget that is visible to these wrappers.

Evidence anchors:

- Layout-local helpers that force **definite** probe budgets:
  - `probe_constraints_for_size(...)` in `crates/fret-ui/src/declarative/host_widget/layout.rs`
  - `probe_constraints_for_size(...)` in `crates/fret-ui/src/declarative/host_widget/layout/positioned_container.rs`
- Positioned containers:
  - `crates/fret-ui/src/declarative/host_widget/layout/positioned_container.rs`
  - uses `probe_available = clamp_to_constraints(cx.available, layout, cx.available)` and measures
    children with `probe_constraints_for_size(probe_bounds.size)` (definite).
- Generic container-like layouts:
  - `crates/fret-ui/src/declarative/host_widget/layout.rs`
  - “Probe within the available height budget” patterns appear in multiple element instances
    (container-ish shells, transform wrappers, anchored wrappers, etc.).
  - Examples in this file:
    - `ElementInstance::RenderTransform`
    - `ElementInstance::FractionalRenderTransform`
    - `ElementInstance::Anchored`

### Flex/Grid probe-pass behavior

`flex`, `grid`, and `text` widgets treat `LayoutPassKind::Probe` as “run measure() under a
viewport-sized budget”, but the budget is now constructed via `LayoutCx::probe_constraints_for_size(...)`
so overflow contexts can override the scroll axis to `MaxContent`.

This preserves “probe pass does not see infinite viewport” invariants on the cross axis, while
still allowing scroll surfaces to opt into DOM/GPUI-like overflow observability.

Evidence anchors:

- Flex: `crates/fret-ui/src/declarative/host_widget/layout/flex.rs`
- Grid: `crates/fret-ui/src/declarative/host_widget/layout/grid.rs`
- Text: `crates/fret-ui/src/declarative/host_widget/layout.rs`

### Absolute-positioned nodes inclusion is inconsistent

Intrinsic measurement probes often exclude absolute-positioned children:

- e.g. `max_non_absolute_children(...)` in `crates/fret-ui/src/declarative/host_widget/measure.rs`

However, post-layout observed bounds unions (used by scroll correctness guardrails today) can
include absolute descendants unless explicitly filtered.

Decision needed for parity:

- Default should likely **exclude** absolute nodes from scroll extents, matching the intuition that
  overlays/chrome should not silently change scroll range.
- If a component wants absolute nodes to affect extents, it should do so explicitly via normal-flow
  wrappers or a dedicated mechanism switch.

### Minimum change set for SE-200 to be viable

To make a “post-layout extents” prototype realistic (without relying on deep pre-layout measure
probes), we likely need at least one of these mechanism-level additions:

1. **Layout-time available-space budgets / overflow contexts**:
   - Add a way for `layout_in(...)` / `LayoutCx` to carry “scroll axis budget is MaxContent” without
     requiring a giant `Rect` bounds.
   - Budget-clamping wrappers (positioned containers, container shells, flex/grid probe paths) must
     consult this budget when probing/measuring children.
2. **A mechanism-level clamp policy hook (scoped)**:
   - Keep `clamp_to_constraints(...)` as the default (it is widely relied on today),
   - but allow scroll roots (or any explicit “overflow context”) to request a different clamp
     policy on the scroll axis, so auto-sized descendants can exceed the viewport and still be
     clipped/observed for extents.
3. **Standardize absolute exclusion (SE-113 implemented)**:
   - Ensure the extent derivation path and the intrinsic measurement path agree on whether absolute
     nodes contribute to extents (default: exclude).
4. **Keep observation bounded and debuggable**:
   - Maintain a bounded scan budget (as we do today) and surface “budget hit” telemetry so we can
     detect cases where wrapper chains exceed peeling/scan limits (SE-114 implemented).

### SE-111 draft: overflow contexts + clamp policy (contract sketch)

Goal: make “fill vs fit vs overflow” an explicit mechanism contract so post-layout extents can be
derived from `node_bounds` without relying on deep pre-layout unbounded probes.

Proposed mechanism-level concepts:

- **Overflow context (inherited)**:
  - Installed at `Scroll` roots (and potentially other explicit overflow surfaces).
  - Carries axis-specific “budget” hints (e.g. `scroll_axis_budget = MaxContent`, `cross_axis_budget = Definite(viewport)`).
  - Intended to influence *measurement/probe constraints*, not to change paint-time clipping.
- **Scoped clamp policy**:
  - Default behavior remains: `clamp_to_constraints(...)` treats `available` as a hard maximum.
  - Under an overflow context, on the **scroll axis only**, auto-sized descendants may exceed the
    viewport-sized `Rect` budget so that overflow is visible in post-layout geometry.
  - Cross axis remains clamped to preserve “no infinite viewport” invariants.

Non-goals:

- Do not implicitly include padding/border/chrome in extents at the mechanism level (policy lives
  in component ecosystems via explicit wrappers).
- Do not make overlays/chrome affect scroll ranges by default (absolute descendants are excluded).

Open questions (to resolve before implementation):

- Should the overflow context be carried on `LayoutCx` (layout-time inherited state) or via
  `LayoutConstraints` (explicit constraints object)?
- What is the minimal set of element/layout implementations that must consult the context to make
  the behavior observable in real trees (docs pages + tab panels)?
- How do we expose “budget hit / under-observed overflow” telemetry without turning it into a
  perf hazard in release builds?

Implementation status:

- SE-112 (initial wiring) is in progress. A minimal `LayoutOverflowContext` exists and is
  propagated through `LayoutCx` / `UiTree::layout_in_with_pass_kind`. In the post-layout extents
  gate, scroll roots install a context that sets the scroll axis probe budget to `MaxContent` so
  wrapper-heavy subtrees can measure descendants without a hard scroll-axis clamp.
- SE-111 (clamp policy hook) is implemented. Under the scroll-installed overflow context, `Auto`
  sizing is allowed to exceed the viewport-sized `available` budget on the scroll axis, so
  overflow becomes visible in `node_bounds` for post-layout extent derivation.
  - Evidence:
    - Context field: `crates/fret-ui/src/layout/overflow.rs` (`allow_overflow_on_auto`)
    - Clamp helper: `crates/fret-ui/src/declarative/layout_helpers.rs` (`clamp_to_constraints_with_overflow_context`)
    - Clamp adoption: `crates/fret-ui/src/declarative/host_widget/layout.rs`
    - Scroll installs: `crates/fret-ui/src/declarative/host_widget/layout/scrolling.rs`
- SE-113 (absolute exclusion parity) is implemented. Post-layout overflow observation now excludes
  absolute-positioned nodes by default, matching the intrinsic measurement skip behavior.
- SE-114 (bounded-observation telemetry) is implemented. When wrapper peeling or bounded deep scan
  hits its budget, `UiDebugScrollNodeTelemetry` records an `overflow_observation` payload for the
  scroll node (and `FRET_DEBUG_SCROLL_EXTENT_PROBE=1` prints a budget-hit log line).
  - Tooling: `fretboard diag query scroll-extents-observation <base_out_dir|session_out_dir|bundle_dir|bundle.schema2.json> --json`
    - The JSON output includes a best-effort `test_id` field (nearest ancestor semantics decoration),
      to make “budget hit” reports easier to triage in UI Gallery pages.
    - Filter modes:
      - Default: only rows where observation hit its wrapper/deep-scan budget (actionable).
      - `--deep-scan`: include rows where a bounded deep scan ran (even if it stayed under budget).
      - `--all`: include all scroll nodes (may be large).
  - Perf note: the bounded deep scan is edge-gated (only allowed when the user is already at the
    current scroll-extent edge and the extent may be stale). This avoids spending scan budget on
    frames where a temporarily stale extent cannot cause “pinned scroll range” regressions.

## Verification Plan (SE-210)

This section defines the minimal set of unit-testable invariants that lock down correctness while
SE-200 remains behind a gate.

### Unit-testable invariants (pure geometry)

- **Observed overflow is in content space**: extents are derived from `node_bounds` projected into
  `content_bounds.origin` coordinates (scroll offsets must not influence extents).
- **Wrapper peeling is safe**: “same-bounds” single-child wrapper chains do not hide overflow.
- **Bounded deep scan catches overflow**: when immediate children bounds do not reveal overflow
  (because wrappers are also forced to the content rect), a bounded DFS can still discover deeper
  overflow and grow extents.

Evidence anchors:

- Implementation: `crates/fret-ui/src/declarative/host_widget/layout/scrolling.rs`
- Unit tests: `crates/fret-ui/src/declarative/host_widget/layout/scrolling.rs`

### Non-unit-testable (for now)

- **Overlay anchoring parity** (reanchoring and scroll extent updates staying in sync) requires a
  higher-level harness (diag scripts or integration tests) and is tracked separately until the
  overlay/anchor query surface is directly assertable in unit tests.

## Reference Direction (GPUI / DOM)

The DOM model (and GPUI’s implementation style) treats scroll extent as a property that can be
derived from **final layout geometry**, rather than requiring an additional “unbounded measure”
probe.

In particular, GPUI computes `content_size` from child layout bounds and then clamps the scroll
offset / computes `max_offset` after layout (see `repo-ref/zed/crates/gpui/src/elements/div.rs`).

This avoids performing a second deep subtree measurement solely to answer “how tall is the scroll
content?”

## Proposed Direction

Move `fret-ui` scroll extent computation toward “post-layout geometry”:

1. Layout children under the viewport-sized box (or otherwise well-defined container bounds).
2. Compute scroll extents from the resulting geometry (child bounds union, plus padding/border).
3. Clamp offsets and expose `max_offset` for scrollbars/automation.

Key constraints:

- Correctness first: no layout oscillation, stable anchor rects for overlays, deterministic scroll
  offset clamping across frames.
- Preserve an escape hatch for “true unbounded” width probing (e.g. code editor horizontal scroll)
  if needed, but avoid using it as the default for common vertical scrolling.

## Implementation Notes / Risks

- `probe_unbounded` currently couples two concerns:
  - how the subtree is measured (intrinsic sizing),
  - how scroll extent is derived.
  Untangling these is likely required.
- Some elements currently clamp measurement to the available size, which effectively forbids
  overflow unless a MaxContent probe is used. Moving toward a DOM-like model may require revisiting
  these constraints and/or introducing explicit “overflow allowed” semantics along the scroll axis.
