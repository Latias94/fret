# ImUi Dear ImGui Gap Closure v1 - Milestones

Status: Active
Last updated: 2026-05-06

## M0 - Current Source Baseline

Exit criteria:

- The lane exists with the minimum doc set.
- The current source audit names current Fret capabilities and Dear ImGui comparison anchors.
- The old standalone parity audit has a status note explaining how to read it.
- Repo trackers point to this lane for current gap-closure sequencing.
- P0 doc/source gates are run.
  Result: done on 2026-05-06.

## M1 - Fearless Cleanup Candidate Selection

Exit criteria:

- One cleanup/delete candidate is chosen from current source evidence.
- The candidate has a named owner crate/doc surface.
- The candidate has a focused gate and a rollback-free delete/refactor plan.
- Any closed historical lane remains closed unless a narrower follow-on is created.
  Current first candidate selected: teaching-surface cleanup for `imui_shadcn_adapter_demo`.
  The first code slice routes `TableSortDirection` through `fret::imui::kit` and extends the
  teaching-source gate so the stale direct `fret_ui_kit::imui::TableSortDirection` import cannot
  return to that default-path example.
  The second code slice routes `workspace_shell_demo` pane-proof option types through
  `fret::imui::kit` and extends both IMUI source gates so direct `fret_ui_kit::imui` imports cannot
  return to that default pane-first proof.
  The third code slice routes `imui_editor_proof_demo` and its `collection.rs` module through the
  app-facing `fret::imui` facade for IMUI option/state types while keeping recipe-layer imports
  explicit. `fret-ui-editor::imui` was audited and remains a thin declarative-control adapter.

## M2 - First Cleanup/Refactor Slice

Exit criteria:

- The first P1 slice lands.
- Public teaching surfaces still prefer the app-facing `fret::imui` path.
- `fret-imui` stays policy-light.
- `fret-ui-editor::imui` stays a thin adapter.
- Focused gates pass.

## M3 - User-Usable Golden Path

Exit criteria:

- A single runnable proof teaches a realistic editor panel path.
- It combines immediate authoring, editor controls, actions/commands, popup/menu behavior, and
  diagnostic hooks.
- Cookbook/docs point at that proof without promoting historical smoke demos as the default path.

## M4 - Follow-On Split

Exit criteria:

- Remaining Dear ImGui-class gaps are split into narrow lanes with owner, repro, gate, and evidence.
- This lane remains the source-audit and priority map, not a dumping ground for all implementation.
