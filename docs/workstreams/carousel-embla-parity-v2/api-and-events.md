# Carousel Embla parity (v2) — API + events (workstream design)

Status: Implemented (MVP; still evolving)

This document captures a **workstream-level** design for a Rust-native `CarouselApi` surface and
its observable event semantics (`select` / `reInit`) while we are still iterating inside
`ecosystem/*`. If/when this surface becomes stable and must be treated as a long-lived contract, we
can promote the key parts into an ADR.

## Why not an ADR (yet)

- The v2 work is still evolving (API shape and ergonomics are not stable).
- The implementation lives in `ecosystem/*` and is expected to iterate quickly.
- We already have regression protection via unit tests + `fretboard diag` scripted gates.

## Layering (non-negotiable)

- `crates/fret-ui`: mechanisms only (routing, capture/cancel semantics, hit-testing).
- `ecosystem/fret-ui-headless`: engine math + deterministic state machines (Embla-aligned helpers).
- `ecosystem/fret-ui-shadcn`: recipes + tokens + ergonomics + docs-aligned demos.

No component policy or physics should move into `crates/fret-ui`.

## Upstream reference outcomes (shadcn/ui v4)

Shadcn’s `Carousel` uses Embla and relies on:

- `setApi(api)` to obtain a handle
- `api.on('select', ...)` to update the “Slide N of M” counter
- `api.on('reInit', ...)` to update `canScrollPrev/Next` (and counters) after geometry changes

Local snapshots:

- Docs: `repo-ref/ui/apps/v4/content/docs/components/carousel.mdx`
- Component: `repo-ref/ui/apps/v4/registry/new-york-v4/ui/carousel.tsx`

## Current in-tree baseline

### Snapshot surface (shipping today)

`ecosystem/fret-ui-shadcn::CarouselApiSnapshot` is a **deterministic** snapshot intended for UI
gallery demos and basic “API” examples without exposing Embla’s imperative API.

It now includes MVP event observability:

- `select_generation`: increments when the selected index changes
- `reinit_generation`: increments when the carousel re-initializes due to geometry changes

This provides an “effect-like” hook in Rust: render code can remember the last generation and react
when it changes.

### `CarouselApi` handle (shipping today)

`ecosystem/fret-ui-shadcn::CarouselApi` is a Rust-native handle published via a model:

- the recipe writes `Some(CarouselApi)` into a `Model<Option<CarouselApi>>` (shadcn `setApi` outcome)
- commands are enqueued via an internal command queue model (no `UiActionHost` required)
- events are observed via a cursor (`CarouselEventCursor`) polled by the caller (no stored closures)

Supported (v2 MVP):

- commands:
  - `scroll_prev`, `scroll_next`, `scroll_to(index)`
- queries (via `snapshot()`):
  - `selected_index`, `snap_count`, `can_scroll_prev`, `can_scroll_next`
- queries (Embla-like helpers):
  - `selected_scroll_snap()`
  - `scroll_snap_list()` (recipe snap offsets; not Embla’s internal sign convention)
  - `slides_in_view()` (when the recipe wires `CarouselSlidesInViewSnapshot`)
- event polling:
  - `events_since(&mut host, &mut cursor)` emits `ReInit` / `Select { selected_index }` when the
    underlying generation counters change

### Internal engine re-init (shipping today)

The recipe rebuilds the headless engine derived state when measured geometry changes:

- `Engine::reinit(...)` recomputes limit/targets/bounds while clamping `location/target` to the new
  limit.
- The recipe triggers re-init when snaps/view size/max offset changes.

## Goals (v2)

1) Provide a Rust-native `CarouselApi` handle with ergonomic methods:
   - `scroll_prev`, `scroll_next`, `scroll_to(index)`
   - `selected_index`, `snap_count`, `can_scroll_prev`, `can_scroll_next`
2) Provide **observable** and **stable** event semantics:
   - `select`
   - `re_init`
3) Avoid storing arbitrary closures inside models.
4) Keep layering intact (no policy creep into `crates/fret-ui`).

## Non-goals (v2)

- Perfect 1:1 mirroring of Embla’s JS API types.
- Requiring React-style effect lifetimes or callback patterns.

## Event semantics (what “correct” means)

### `select`

Contract:

- A `select` event is emitted when `selected_index` changes.
- It should be “exactly once” per index transition (no duplicates per frame).

MVP implementation approach:

- Increment `select_generation` when `selected_index` changes (after clamping / snap selection).

### `reInit`

Contract:

- A `reInit` event is emitted when geometry changes cause a re-initialization that can affect:
  - snap list
  - scroll limits / bounds config
  - view size
- It must be safe to emit multiple times during continuous resize.

MVP implementation approach:

- Increment `reinit_generation` when the recipe observes a meaningful geometry delta
  (snaps/maxOffset/viewSize changed and view size is measurable).

Ordering:

- If a re-init causes a selected index change, a `select` event must also occur.
- The exact ordering between `reInit` and `select` is not required to match Embla perfectly, but it
  must be stable and documented.

## Resize throttling (decision)

Embla can emit `reInit` during continuous resize. In a native renderer, emitting an observable
`reInit` signal on every geometry change is often too noisy for app-level state (counters, button
states, logging).

Decision (v2 MVP):

- We may re-initialize the internal engine whenever geometry changes.
- The observable `reInit` signal is **throttled** to *at most once per N frames* during continuous
  geometry churn.

Current implementation:

- `N = 4` frames (best-effort; tuned for stability, not a hard public API guarantee).
  - Note: this can delay an observable `reInit` signal by up to `N - 1` frames after a geometry
    change. The engine may still re-initialize internally immediately for correctness.
  - We also avoid dropping re-inits: if a geometry change is detected but throttled, we emit a
    single `reInit` once geometry stabilizes (the next frame with no further changes).

Rationale:

- keeps UI gallery demos readable (no event storms)
- keeps diag bundles smaller and less variable
- still provides timely updates during interactive resize

Evidence anchors:

- Recipe throttling: `ecosystem/fret-ui-shadcn/src/carousel.rs`
- Gate: `ecosystem/fret-ui-shadcn/tests/carousel_api_generations.rs`
- Handle + cursor: `ecosystem/fret-ui-shadcn/src/carousel.rs`
- Gate: `ecosystem/fret-ui-shadcn/tests/carousel_api_handle.rs`
- UI gallery example: `apps/fret-ui-gallery/src/ui/pages/carousel.rs`

## Proposed evolution path

### Phase 1 (now): generation counters + gates

- Treat `CarouselApiSnapshot` generations as the MVP “event system”.
- Update UI gallery API demo to optionally use generations (no API handle yet).
- Add/keep diag gates:
  - inertia pixels changed
  - resize during engine-driven motion does not panic and content stays visible

### Phase 2 (now): `CarouselApi` handle

The handle is implemented in-tree and used by the UI gallery `carousel-api` demo.

### Phase 3: stabilize and consider ADR

When:

- other crates/components depend on this surface,
- and we want the surface to be hard-to-change,

then promote the key parts to an ADR.

## Gates (must remain executable)

- Unit tests (recommended):
  - `select_generation` increments exactly once per index change.
  - `reinit_generation` increments on snap/viewport changes.
  - `reinit_generation` is throttled during continuous geometry churn.
  - handle commands advance selection and emit observable events:
    - `ecosystem/fret-ui-shadcn/tests/carousel_api_handle.rs`
- Diag scripts:
  - `tools/diag-scripts/ui-gallery/carousel/ui-gallery-carousel-demo-inertia-pixels-changed.json`
  - `tools/diag-scripts/ui-gallery/carousel/ui-gallery-carousel-demo-reinit-resize-gate.json`
